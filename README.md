# Implementation of Ke Zhao et al. SMEM: A Spontaneous Micro-Expression Dataset in Museum
## Algorithm 




## Dataset Description
The SMEM dataset is comprised of 344 video clips collected from 127 participants in the context of a museum for analyzing micro-expression of visitors. The SMEM dataset can be divided into two subsets, a Lab-SMEM and an Authentic-SMEM. In the Lab-SMEM, 226 ME samples are collected in a laboratory setting by following the standard paradigm for micro-expression collection. In the Authentic-SMEM, we collected 118 ME samples recorded from the real-world museum setting.![image](https://github.com/guangqianyang/ME-recognition-in-museum/assets/154820128/cdc7631f-7afd-4ec9-a203-6cb53dec3549)
